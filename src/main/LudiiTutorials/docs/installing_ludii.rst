Installing Ludii
================

Prerequisites
-------------

Ludii requires Java version 8 or higher to be installed on your computer. 
Java can be downloaded from: `<https://www.java.com/download/>`_. 
Ludii should run correctly on any major operating system. It has been verified 
to run correctly on the following operating systems:

* Windows 10.
* OS X El Capitan 10.11.6, OS X Mojave 10.14.3.
* Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 19.04.

Download and Installation
-------------------------

The latest version of Ludii may always be downloaded from
`Ludii's downloads page <https://ludii.games/download.php>`_. This page also
contains an archive of older versions of Ludii, and various extra downloads
(such as documentation).

No additional installation steps are required -- after downloading Ludii, it can
be used directly. However, because Ludii occasionally writes files in the directory
that it is run from, it may be convenient to place it in a directory of its own somewhere.

Running Ludii
-------------

The easiest way to launch Ludii is to double-click the downloaded ``Ludii.jar`` file. 
Alternatively, it may be launched by navigating to the directory containing the 
``Ludii.jar`` file in a command prompt, and entering:

.. code-block:: bash

  java -jar Ludii.jar
  
The Ludii downloads page also contains `an extensive user guide <https://ludii.games/downloads/LudiiUserGuide.pdf>`_,
which explains how to use Ludii.
